## Summary

This application called "Google-Books Search" allows the user to search for a book, save a book, and also look at more information at the book via google books homepage.
<br>
<br>
Everything was created using ReactJS (An open source JavaScript Library). 
An API was used so we can grab all the books that is being searched from the google books page: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=.
<br>
<br>
There is one special library that was used on this which is called Animate.CSS. This library created animations that are used on the web design. As you can see when you open the deployed link (Listed above), you can see that the nav bar will have a "fadeIn" effect, which is followed by the "jackInTheBox" jumbotron effect with a 2 seconds delay, and then last followed by the search form that will "rollIn" from the left of the screen. This library is great if you want to make your web page look more alive and fun.
